class VerifyScheduler:
    """Hardware-Aware Prefix Scheduler for confidence-scheduled block drafting.

    Owns the per-request verify-length (``ell``) machinery shared by any
    confidence-scheduled block drafter (DSpark today; e.g. a future Qwen block
    drafter next). Given the draft confidence head output it picks each request's
    verify length ``ell_r`` (paper Algorithm 1), then carries that ell across
    steps keyed by req_id (continuous batching reorders the batch between steps).

    Named for its product (the per-request verify length) rather than its input
    signal: the confidence head is one input to the schedule, but the class's job
    is to decide how many draft tokens each request verifies next step.

    The cost model inputs (``sps_table`` throughput profile, ``sts_temperatures``)
    are bound later by the runner's warmup/calibration; until then a synthetic
    monotone SPS stub keeps the path lossless.

    Kept sync-free on the decode hot path: ``record_ell`` fires an ASYNC D2H of
    ell to a pinned buffer and the {req_id: ell} map is materialized lazily.
