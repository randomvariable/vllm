    Generalizes maybe_execute_in_parallel to N aux callables. Slots where
    aux_fns[i] is None are skipped (no stream switch, no event record); their
    corresponding entry in the returned aux_results list is None.

    start_event fans out from the current stream to every launched aux stream;
    done_events[i] is recorded after aux_fns[i] so the current stream joins
    before returning. Falls back to sequential execution on the current stream
    when aux_streams is None or enable is False; in that case default_fn runs
    first, then aux_fns in order.

    Args:
        default_fn: Callable for the default (current) stream.
        aux_fns: Per-aux callables; entries may be None to skip.
        start_event: CUDA event recorded on the current stream before
            default_fn so each launched aux stream can wait on it.
        done_events: One CUDA event per aux slot, recorded after the
            corresponding aux_fn. Length must match aux_fns.
        aux_streams: Per-aux CUDA streams. Length must match aux_fns.
            Multi-stream is disabled when None.
        enable: Opt-in switch for the multi-stream path. Defaults to False,
            so callers that pass aux_streams must also pass enable=True
            (typically gated by an env var) to actually overlap. When False,
            execution falls back to sequential on the current stream.
        enqueue_default_first: Enqueue ``default_fn`` before walking the
            auxiliary callables. The CUDA dependency graph is unchanged: all
            branches still wait on ``start_event`` and the default stream joins
            every launched auxiliary branch before returning. This option is
            useful when an auxiliary callable performs many host-side launches;
