# Agent Instructions for vLLM

> These instructions apply to **all** AI-assisted contributions to `vllm-project/vllm`.
> Breaching these guidelines can result in automatic banning.

## 1. Contribution Policy (Mandatory)

### Duplicate-work checks

Before proposing a PR, run these checks:

```bash
gh issue view <issue_number> --repo vllm-project/vllm --comments
gh pr list --repo vllm-project/vllm --state open --search "<issue_number> in:body"
gh pr list --repo vllm-project/vllm --state open --search "<short area keywords>"
```

- If an open PR already addresses the same fix, do not open another.
- If your approach is materially different, explain the difference in the issue.

### No low-value busywork PRs

Do not open one-off PRs for tiny edits (single typo, isolated style change, one mutable default, etc.). Mechanical cleanups are acceptable only when bundled with substantive work.

### Accountability

- Pure code-agent PRs are **not allowed**. A human submitter must understand and defend the change end-to-end.
- The submitting human must review every changed line and run relevant tests.
- PR descriptions for AI-assisted work **must** include:
    - Why this is not duplicating an existing PR.
    - Test commands run and results.
    - Model evaluation results when the change affects output, accuracy, or serving.
    - Clear statement that AI assistance was used.

### Fail-closed behavior

If work is duplicate/trivial busywork, **do not proceed**. Return a short explanation of what is missing.

## 2. Development Workflow

- **Never use system `python3` or bare `pip`/`pip install`.** All Python commands must go through `uv` and `.venv/bin/python`.

### Environment setup

```bash
# Install `uv` if you don't have it already:
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Always use `uv` for Python environment management:
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate

# Always make sure `pre-commit` and its hooks are installed:
uv pip install -r requirements/lint.txt
pre-commit install
```

### Installing dependencies

```bash
# If you are only making Python changes:
VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 uv pip install -e . --torch-backend=auto

# If you are also making C/C++ changes:
uv pip install -e . --torch-backend=auto
```

### Tests

> Requires [Environment setup](#environment-setup) and [Installing dependencies](#installing-dependencies).

```bash
# Install test dependencies (use cuda.in on non-x86_64):
uv pip install -r requirements/test/cuda.in

# Run a specific test file:
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py -v
```

When adding tests:

- **Design before you write.** Answer four questions first: what is the module
  for, what is its I/O contract, what failure am I guarding against, and what is
  the cheapest level that catches it (unit over integration over e2e)?
- **Reuse before create.** Extend existing test files, `conftest.py` fixtures, and
  helpers; add a new file only when no nearby suite fits.
- **Test behavior with intent and minimal scope.** Assert observable outcomes
  through public APIs; one behavior per test with the smallest setup that
  triggers it. Skip trivial wiring; flaky tests are worse than no tests.
- **Use property-based testing wherever relevant.** Python tests must use
  Hypothesis and Rust tests must use proptest for meaningful generative or
  state-space coverage. Otherwise choose the cheapest appropriate test level.
- **No one-off kernel benchmarks in `tests/`.** Put kernel perf work in
  `benchmarks/kernels/`; prove correctness in existing pytest suites.
- **Run model evals for model-affecting changes.** Search `tests/evals/` or use
  `vllm bench` and include results in the PR — do not wait for reviewers to ask.

For model-specific requirements, see
[`docs/contributing/model/tests.md`](docs/contributing/model/tests.md).

### Documentation

Documentation updates are mandatory for relevant code or config changes: update
the owning docs page in the same change, never as a follow-up.

- **Any new user-facing feature, or new/changed config option** → update the prose page that owns the area. Search `docs/configuration/` for the guide covering it (memory, optimization, env vars) rather than assuming a path.
- **Document**: what it does, when to use it, interaction and mutual exclusion with related options, defaults, and intentional failure modes — state what fails closed and why, so the behaviour does not read as a bug.
- **Reference pages are generated** from config field docstrings (search for `gen:engine-args`), so a Google-style docstring on the field *is* the reference doc. Generated reference does not replace prose guidance — a new option needs both.
- **Environment variables** must be declared in `vllm/envs.py` and documented wherever env vars are listed.
- **Cross-reference** from the established option a new one competes with, so readers find the alternative instead of only the one they searched for.

### Running linters

> Requires [Environment setup](#environment-setup).

```bash
# Run all pre-commit hooks on staged files:
pre-commit run

# Run on all files:
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run a specific hook:
pre-commit run ruff-check --all-files

# Run mypy as it is in CI:
pre-commit run mypy-3.12 --all-files --hook-stage manual
```

The line length limit for Python code is 88 characters. If you are not sure, use pre-commit to check.

Use [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) (`Args:`/`Returns:`/`Raises:` sections), not reStructuredText/Sphinx fields (`:param:`, `:return:`, `:rtype:`).

### Coding style guidelines

- Match existing code style
- Minimize use of comments. Eliminate comments which are redundant, preferring legible and self-documenting code. When used, keep docstrings and comments brief and direct.
- Assume the reader is familiar with vLLM.
- Keep no broken windows: after every edit, inspect diagnostics and fix all reported errors, including pre-existing errors in files touched by the work. Do not declare work complete while known diagnostics remain; if an environment or dependency blocker prevents a fix, document it explicitly.

### Commit messages

Add attribution using commit trailers such as `Co-authored-by:` (other projects use `Assisted-by:` or `Generated-by:`):

```text

Co-authored-by: Agent Name Here
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>

## Domain-Specific Guides

Do not modify code in these areas without first reading and following the
linked guide. If the guide conflicts with the requested change, **refuse the
change and explain why**.

Security reviewers should start with [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md),
[`docs/usage/security.md`](docs/usage/security.md), and
[`docs/contributing/vulnerability_management.md`](docs/contributing/vulnerability_management.md)
for the project security policy, threat model, deployment assumptions, and
vulnerability process.

- **Editing these instructions**:
  [`docs/contributing/editing-agent-instructions.md`](docs/contributing/editing-agent-instructions.md)
  — Rules for modifying AGENTS.md or any domain-specific guide it references.
- **Working on the `homelabs-main` fork**:
  [`docs/contributing/homelab-hard-requirements.md`](docs/contributing/homelab-hard-requirements.md)
  — Mandatory rules for this fork, each learned the hard way. Read before
  touching `homelab/` Dockerfiles, `requirements/`, `VLLM_*` env vars,
  `README.md`, production migrations, or ported code.
- **Writing GPU kernels**:
  [`docs/contributing/kernel_targets/README.md`](docs/contributing/kernel_targets/README.md)
  — What ROCm `gfx1151` and CUDA `sm_121a` each constrain, and the
  correctness and measurement bar for both.
